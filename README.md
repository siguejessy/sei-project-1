Simon - An interactive memorization game.

This is a virtual recreation of the real-world popular toy, Simon, co-invented by “The Father of Video Games”, Ralph H. Baer and released by Milton-Bradley in 1978.

Fun-fact: The original Simon’s grand debut was at a special Midnight Release Party during the 1978 holiday season at Studio 54 in NYC!


Objective: Beat your previous high score (or a friend’s high score!) by correctly repeating Simon’s pattern and advancing through rounds.


How to play Simon: Simon is a game of mimic and memorization! Simon is an expert pattern builder and will build a sequential pattern for you to mimic before advancing to the next round.
